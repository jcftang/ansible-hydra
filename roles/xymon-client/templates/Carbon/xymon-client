# Configure the Xymon client settings.

# You MUST set the list of Xymon servers that this
# client reports to.
# It is good to use IP-adresses here instead of DNS
# names - DNS might not work if there's a problem.
#
# E.g. (a single Xymon server)
#   XYMONSERVERS="192.168.1.1"
# or (multiple servers)
#   XYMONSERVERS="10.0.0.1 192.168.1.1"

XYMONSERVERS="{{groups.monitoring[0]}}"

# The defaults usually suffice for the rest of this file,
# but you can tweak the hostname that the client reports
# data with.
# CLIENTHOSTNAME=""

# Red Hat EL version 3 uses a different vmstat layout
# than all other Linux versions. So for a client running this
# particular OS, set CLIENTOS as below.
# Do NOT set this on any other Red Hat version.
# CLIENTOS="rhel3"


# Configure xymonlaunch(8) runtime settings here. All other options,
# and flags for other daemons should be, set in the tasks.cfg(5) file.

# XYMONLAUNCHOPTS="--debug --env=/etc/xymon-client/xymonclient.cfg"
